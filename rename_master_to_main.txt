# From: https://hackernoon.com/how-to-rename-your-git-repositories-from-master-to-main-6i1u3wsu

# At local repository:

git branch -m master main	# rename the local "master" branch in local repositories to "main"
git branch  				# confirm
git checkout main 		# confirm that your current HEAD branch is the newly created "main". 
git push -u origin main 	# push this branch to create it on the remote


# At remote repository:
# Go to repository
# Go to settings > branches
# Change default branch to main and confirm

# At local repository:
git push origin --delete master		# delete the "master" from remote via local
