Do the following steps for a file/folder:

Remove a File:

need to add that file to .gitignore.
need to remove that file using the command (git rm --cached file name).
need to run (git add .).
need to (commit -m) "file removed".
and finally, (git push).
For example:

I want to delete the test.txt file. I accidentally pushed to GitHub and want to remove it. Commands will be as follows:

First, add "test.txt" in file .gitignore

git rm --cached test.txt
git add .
git commit -m "test.txt removed"
git push
Remove Folder:

need to add that folder to file .gitignore.
need to remove that folder using the command (git rm -r --cached folder name).
need to run (git add .).
need to (commit -m) "folder removed".
and finally, (git push).
For example:

I want to delete the .idea folder/directory. I accidentally pushed to GitHub and want to remove it. The commands will be as follows:

First, add .idea in file .gitignore

git rm -r --cached .idea
git add .
git commit -m ".idea removed"
git push
